## Description

This is a game I made for Ludum Dare 45 (theme: start with nothing). In the game, you are a homeless who is collecting recyclable materials in order to make some money. Each day you *start with nothing* in your cart, and walk along the street collecting stuff. A tower of materials forms in your cart and you have to speed up (**right arrow**) or slow down (**left arrow**) to balance it and prevent it from falling apart.

Tip: Just press the right arrow repeatedly from time to time in order to balance the tower and increase speed.

I made the game using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). The font I used is ["pixelated" by Greenma201](https://www.dafont.com/pixelated.font). You are not deaf, the game has no sound really. And I drew these amazingly beautiful graphics myself using inkscape... :D
